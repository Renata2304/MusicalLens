This project presents the development of an innovative Android application designed to digitize musical scores and enable audio playback through advanced image processing techniques. The system employs Optical Music Recognition (OMR) for the accurate detection of musical notation (including notes, staves, and symbols) alongside Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for lyric extraction.

To ensure high processing accuracy, the application incorporates image preprocessing functionalities such as noise reduction, contrast enhancement, and skew correction. Following data extraction, the scanned scores are converted into a digital format, allowing users to generate and listen to audio renditions. Additionally, the application supports exporting scores in MIDI format, enabling seamless editing and standardized sharing.

The primary objective of this work is to provide musicians with an efficient tool for converting physical sheet music into accessible digital resources, thereby modernizing music study, composition, and archival processes.
